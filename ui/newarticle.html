		<h1>History of Programming Languages</h1>
		<p>	The History and Influence of Programming Languages</p>
		<p> <strong> 1957 - Fortran</strong> (short for “The IBM Mathematical Formula Translating System”) General-purpose, high-level. For numeric and scientific computing (as an alternative to assembly language). Oldest programming language still used today.
		</p><p>
		<strong>1958 - Lisp</strong> (short for “List Processor”) High-level. For mathematical notation. Several new computer science topics: tree data structures, automatic storage management, dynamic typing, and self-hosting compilers
		 </p><p>
		<strong>1959 - Cobol </strong>(short for "Common Business-Oriented Language) High-level. Primarily for business computing. First programming language to be mandated by the US Department of Defense.
		 </p><p>
		<strong>1964 - BASIC </strong>(acronym for “Beginner’s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code”)General-purpose, high-level. Designed for simplicity. Popularity exploded in the mid-‘70s with home computers; early computer games were often written in Basic, including Mike Mayfield’s Star Trek.
		 </p><p>
		<strong>1970 - Pascal</strong> (after French mathematician/physicist Blaise Pascal) High-level. For teaching structured programming and data structuring. Commercial versions widely used throughout the ‘80s.
		 </p><p>
		<strong>1972 - C </strong>(based on an earlier language called "B") General-purpose, low-level. Created for Unix systems. Currently the world’s most popular programming language.2 Many leading languages are derivatives, including C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, and Python.
		 </p><p>
		<strong>1980 - Ada</strong> (After Ada Lovelace, inventor of the first programming language) High-level. Derived from Pascal. Contracted by the US Department of Defense in 1977 for developing large software systems.
		 </p><p>
		<strong>1983 - C++</strong> (formerly “C with Classes”; ++ is the increment operator in “C”) Intermediate-level, object-oriented. An extension of C, with enhancements such as classes, virtual functions, and templates.
		 </p><p>
		<strong>1983 - Objective-C</strong> (object-oriented extension of “C”) General-purpose, high-level. Expanded on C, adding message-passing functionality based on Smalltalk language.
		 </p><p>
		<strong>1987 - Perl </strong>(a language named "PEARL" already existed, so "Pearl" wasn't an option...)General-purpose, high-level. Created for report processing on Unix systems. Today it’s known for high power and versatility.
		 </p><p>
		<strong>1991 - Python</strong> (for British comedy troupe Monty Python – tutorials, sample code, and instructions often reference them) General-purpose, high-level. Created to support a variety of programming styles and be fun to use.
		 </p><p>
		<strong>1993 - Ruby</strong> (the birthstone of one of the creator's collaborator) General-purpose, high-level. A teaching language influence by Perl, Ada, Lisp, Smalltalk, etc. Designed for productive and enjoyable programming.
		 </p><p>
		<strong>1995 - Java</strong> (for the amount of coffee consumed while developing the language)General-purpose, high-level. Made for an interactive TV project. Cross-platform functionality. Second most popular language (behind C).2
		 </p><p>
		<strong>1995 - PHP</strong> ("Personal Home Page") Open-source, general-purpose. For building dynamic web pages. Most widely used open-source software by enterprises.
		 </p><p>
		<strong>1995 - JavaScript </strong>(final choice after "Mocha" and "LiveScript" High-level. Created to extend web page functionality. Dynamic web pages use for form submission/validation, interactivity, animations, user activity tracking, etc.

		<h3> Nine Tips for Secure Programming</h3>

		<p>1.	Always check for OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities
		</p><p>2.	Ensure that sensitive data is properly encoded and encrypted
		</p><p>3.	Use access control and permissions to protect resources and limit application/user capabilities
		</p><p>5.	Write code that is capable of handling exceptions (errors) securely
		</p><p>6.	Write code that is free of hardcoded credentials or cryptographic keys
		</p><p>7.	Use passwords and session management practices to verify users
		</p><p>8.	Store data securely
		</p><p>9.	Implement comprehensive yet realistic security policies
